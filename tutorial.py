Understanding Phishing Attacks

Phishing is a type of cyber attack where criminals attempt to trick you into:
• Revealing sensitive information (passwords, credit card numbers)
• Downloading malicious software
• Sending money or valuable data

These attacks often come via email but can also arrive as:
• Text messages (SMiShing)
• Phone calls (Vishing)
• Fake websites

Phishing emails often pretend to be from trusted organizations like:
• Your bank or credit card company
• Popular services (Microsoft, Google, Apple)
• Shipping companies (FedEx, DHL, UPS)
• Your employer's IT department

How to Spot Phishing Emails

Look for these common warning signs:

1. Suspicious Sender Address:
   - Check if the domain matches the organization's real domain
   - Watch for slight misspellings (e.g., 'amaz0n.com' instead of 'amazon.com')

2. Urgency and Threats:
   - 'Your account will be closed in 24 hours!'
   - 'Immediate action required'
   - 'Failure to respond will result in...'

3. Generic Greetings:
   - 'Dear Customer' instead of your name
   - 'Dear User' or 'Dear Account Holder'

4. Suspicious Links:
   - Hover over links to see the real destination
   - Watch for URLs that don't match the organization's website

5. Requests for Sensitive Information:
   - Legitimate companies won't ask for passwords via email
   - Be wary of requests for credit card numbers or personal details

6. Poor Grammar and Spelling:
   - Professional organizations proofread their communications
   - Many phishing emails originate overseas and have language errors

7. Unexpected Attachments:
   - Especially .exe, .zip, or other executable files
   - Even PDFs can contain malicious content

Protecting Yourself from Phishing

Follow these security best practices:

1. Verify Before Clicking:
   - Hover over links to see the actual URL
   - When in doubt, go directly to the official website

2. Don't Open Unexpected Attachments:
   - Especially from unknown senders
   - Even expected attachments can be malicious if the email is compromised

3. Use Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):
   - Even if your password is stolen, MFA can prevent access

4. Keep Software Updated:
   - Ensure your OS, browser, and security software are current

5. Report Suspicious Emails:
   - Forward phishing attempts to your IT security team
   - Use your email client's 'Report Phishing' feature

6. Educate Yourself Continuously:
   - Phishing tactics evolve constantly
   - Participate in regular security awareness training

Remember: When in doubt, throw it out! If an email seems suspicious, 
it's better to delete it or verify through another channel.
